# natural-packing
This is the work done by the Natural Packing subteam (Ella van Engen, Claire Wiebe, and Jay Patel), a part of the Quantifying Gerrymandering reasearch team at Duke led by Jonathan Mattingly and Gregory Herschlag. The goal of this team was to improve the map generating algorithm that was a key reason for the ruling that the North Carolina map was gerrymandered by the Republican party and must be redrawn for the 2020 elections. The Natural Packing team's goal was to analyze the effects of people with similar political views living closely together on voting results. 

Specifically, I performed K-nearest neighbor analysis and torus map simulations using Python and real world data for 4 states (NC, WI, PA, and MD) to find that Democrats and Republicans are asymmetrically clustered, but that Democrats are not significantly more clustered than Republicans contrary to what people may think due to cities being densely populated and often very liberal. 

All of my code can be found in naturalpacking/src, and the technical reports linked here contain a detailed description that I wrote for all of our code. I wrote all of the code detailed in these documents besides the last 4 programs in Spring 2019: avgseats.py, Outcome.py, Pdf.py, and Slope.py.
